# LearningC64

This is a repos to store my C64 assembly programs. It's mostly really easy stuff!
Assembled with KickAssembler.

# How to run

A makefile is provided to help compiling and running the programs. You can edit it if needed.
Compile a file like so:
```
make file=rasterline
```
By default, it will launch the vice emulator automatically.

To clean unwanted prg, sym and log files, you can run:
```
make clean
```
